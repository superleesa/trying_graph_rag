**Goal:**
Extract entities of specified types from the text and identify relationships among them.

**Instructions:**

1. **Entity Extraction:**
   - For each entity, provide:
     - **entity_name**: Capitalized name
     - **entity_type**: One of [{entity_types}]
     - **entity_description**: Description of attributes and activities
   - Format:
     ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. **Relationship Identification:**
   - For each pair of related entities:
     - **source_entity**: Name from step 1
     - **target_entity**: Name from step 1
     - **relationship_description**: Explanation of their connection
     - **relationship_strength**: Numeric score of relationship strength
   - Format:
     ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. **Output:**
   - Provide a single list of all entities and relationships.
   - Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
   - End with {completion_delimiter}

**Examples:**

*Example 1:*

Entity_types: [person, technology, mission, organization, location]

Text:
*While Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration...*

Output:
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}"Alex"{tuple_delimiter}"person"{tuple_delimiter}"Alex is frustrated and observant of others."){record_delimiter}
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}"Taylor"{tuple_delimiter}"person"{tuple_delimiter}"Taylor shows authoritarian certainty..."){record_delimiter}
("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}"Alex"{tuple_delimiter}"Taylor"{tuple_delimiter}"Alex is affected by Taylor's attitude."{tuple_delimiter}7){completion_delimiter}

*Example 2:*

Entity_types: [person, technology, mission, organization, location]

Text:
*They were no longer mere operatives...*

Output:
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}"Operation: Dulce"{tuple_delimiter}"mission"{tuple_delimiter}"A mission that has evolved to interact and prepare."){record_delimiter}
("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}"The team"{tuple_delimiter}"Operation: Dulce"{tuple_delimiter}"The team is involved in Operation: Dulce."{tuple_delimiter}9){completion_delimiter}
