- **Title**: A short, specific name representing the community's key entities. Include representative named entities when possible.
- **Summary**: An executive summary of the community's overall structure, how entities are related, and significant information about them.
- **Impact Severity Rating**: A float score between 0-10 representing the severity of impact posed by entities within the community.
- **Rating Explanation**: A single sentence explaining the impact severity rating.
- **Detailed Findings**: A list of 5-10 key insights about the community. Each insight should have a short summary and explanatory text grounded according to the grounding rules.

Return the output as a well-formed JSON-formatted string in the following format:
