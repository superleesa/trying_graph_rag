**Goal:**
Extract entities of specified types from the text and identify relationships among them.

**Instructions:**

1. **Entity Extraction:**
   - For each entity, provide:
     - **entity_name**: Capitalized name
     - **entity_type**: One of [{entity_types}]
     - **entity_description**: Description of attributes and activities
   - Collect all entities in a list called `"entities"`.
   - **Note:** Detect all entities in this step, as entities not detected here cannot be used in relationships.

2. **Relationship Identification:**
   - For each pair of related entities:
     - **source_entity**: Name from step 1
     - **target_entity**: Name from step 1
     - **relationship_description**: Explanation of their connection
     - **relationship_strength**: Numeric score of relationship strength (**do not forget this**)
   - Collect all relationships in a list called `"relationships"`.
   - **Note:** Do **not** use entities that were not extracted in the first step as source or target entities.

3. **Output:**
   - Provide a single JSON object with two keys: `"entities"` and `"relationships"`.
   - `"entities"`: List of entity objects.
   - `"relationships"`: List of relationship objects.
   - **You do not need to provide explanations** (only the lists of entities and relationships).
   - Output the JSON object as plain text.
