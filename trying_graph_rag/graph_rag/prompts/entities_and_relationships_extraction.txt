**Goal:**
Extract entities of specified types from the text and identify relationships among them.

**Instructions:**

1. **Entity Extraction:**
   - For each entity, provide:
     - **entity_name**: Capitalized name
     - **entity_type**: One of [{entity_types}]
     - **entity_description**: Description of attributes and activities
   - **Note:** Detect all entities in this step, as entities not detected here cannot be used in relationships.

2. **Relationship Identification:**
   - For each pair of related entities:
     - **source_entity**: Name from step 1
     - **target_entity**: Name from step 1
     - **relationship_description**: Explanation of their connection
     - **relationship_strength**: Numeric score of relationship strength (**do not forget this**)
   - **Note:** Do **not** use entities that were not extracted in the first step as source or target entities.

3. **Output:**
   - Output each entity and relationship as a separate JSON object on its own line (JSON Lines format).
   - For entities, include a key `"record_type": "entity"`.
   - For relationships, include a key `"record_type": "relationship"`.
   - **Do not include any additional text outside the JSON objects.**
   - **Do not include explanations or extra formatting.**
